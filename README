MailWrangler iPhone Application

This code somewhat works. It has been barely updated to work with the latest
iPhone development frameworks. It was originally designed and built for the
first iPhone SDK.

I've decided to release it as open source software (Apache 2.0 License) due to
interest from other developers.
